Hi, this is my Experiment Archive.
## Fedora-On-A-SSD
### Description
I Installed Fedora on a SSD.
### How? 
#### Step 1
I used a 1 TB WD My Passport Go SSD and a SanDisk 32 GB USB Stick. I made a Fedora KDE 42 bootable disk out of the USB stick with Fedora Media Writer (https://flathub.org/apps/org.fedoraproject.MediaWriter).
#### Step 2
I then booted into the USB stick with the SSD plugged in via the One Time Boot Menu from my DELL Inspiron 5379. Then i selected the Fedora KDE option in GRUB.
#### Step 3
I then installed Fedora KDE on the SSD with the Anaconda Installer.
#### Step 4
I then booted into my SSD (using the one time boot menu, again).
#### Step 5
I enjoyed Fedora KDE on my SSD. By the way, you can plug it into any PC and boot Fedora KDE with this tutorial document
